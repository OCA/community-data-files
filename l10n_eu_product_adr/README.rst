This addon adds possibility to mark products with dangerous class due to
European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods
by Road (ADR)

If your products contain dangerous product or waste you can link the relevant
ADR goods to each product.

Based on the dangerous goods classes and the product quantities or weights,
the picking will show the number of ADR points on the Other Info tab.

Configuration
=============

On the product form, you can mark a product as `dangerous`. That will enable
a new tab on the product form's notebook on which you can select the dangerous
goods that applies to this particular product, out of a list of dangerous
goods that represents Table A from chapter 3 of the ADR specifications
document.

It is possible to specify a different, or no goods per product variant.

The data in this module is generated based on a spreadsheet from
https://cepa.be. This spreadsheet, just like the specifications themselves
sometimes contain multiple options for each dangerous good, or additional
restrictions that apply. That complexity is not encoded in the data in this
module. For each dangerous goods that you configure on the products in your
database, you should verify the correctness of the data against the latest
version of the specifications and in case of additional restrictions or
multiple options for the dangerous goods you should configure the goods
according to the situation in your warehouse. You can access the configuration
of the dangerous goods using menu *Inventory -> Configuration -> Dangerous
Goods*.

The number of ADR points on the picking is based on the product weight field
if it is filled in, or otherwise on the UoM quantity in the product's reference
UoM (presumably Liter or Kilogram).

This module defines an ADR user group and an ADR admin group. Membership of
one of these groups is required to access the product tab with the ADR info.
By default, all inventory users are added to the ADR user group.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Dangerous products may also have temperature control to track goods in stock
  and delivery
* Allow an effective label selection for products in class 7, as all labels in
  that class may apply to all products (but not at the same time).
* Update the data in this module beyond the 2019 version of the specifications

Changelog
=========
