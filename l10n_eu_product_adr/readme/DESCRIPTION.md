This addon adds possibility to mark products with dangerous class due to
European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous
Goods by Road (ADR)

If your products contain dangerous product or waste you can link the
relevant ADR goods to each product.

Based on the dangerous goods classes and the product quantities or
weights, the picking will show the number of ADR points on the Other
Info tab.
