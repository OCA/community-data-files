This module adds two fields *UNECE Type Code* and *UNECE Category Code*
on taxes to allow the use of the standards written by the [United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe](http://www.unece.org) (which has
56 members states in Europe, America and Central Asia, cf
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe)):

- the UNECE Tax Type code is defined in the [DataElement
  5153](http://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/d97b/uncl/uncl5153.htm),
- the UNECE Tax Category Code is defined in the [DataElement
  5305](http://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/d97a/uncl/uncl5305.htm).

This codification is part of the UNCL (United Nations Code List). This
codification is used for example in the two main international standards
for electronic invoicing:

- [Cross Industry
  Invoice](http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm)
  (CII),
- [Universal Business Language](http://ubl.xml.org/) (UBL).
