Once this module is installed, you can assign NACE categories to your
partners by simply adding the corresponding category in the partner's
form.

## Obtaining updated data

The data is imported from the new NACE Rev. 2 classification, which is
hosted in ShowVoc. This is a new platform that replaces the old Eurostat
RAMON service and uses SPARQL to retrieve the data.

If you want to import or update the data, you can do so by running the
Import NACE Wizard. This will search for all active languages in Odoo
and import the data for each one. **If you activate a new language,
remember to run this wizard again.**

1.  Go to "Contacts" \> "Configuration" \> "Import NACE industries"
2.  Click on the "Import NACE" button.

This might take a minute or so depending on the number of languages and
the speed of your connection.
