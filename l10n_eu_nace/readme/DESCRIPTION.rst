This module adds the concept of NACE activity to the partner.

The *Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community*
commonly referred to as NACE, is a European industry standard classification
system using a 6 digit code.
NACE is equivalent to the SIC and NAICS system:
* Standard Industrial Classification
* North American Industry Classification System.

This module allows you to select in partner form NACE activities in a multi
label input (many2many)

This addon is inspired in OCA/community-data-files/l10n_eu_nace, but it does
not use partner categories to assign NACE activities to partner.
