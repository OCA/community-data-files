This module imports the NACE rev. 2 classification
categories as partner categories in 23 languages, courtesy of the EU.

The *Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community*
commonly referred to as NACE, is a European industry standard classification
system using a 6 digit code.
NACE is equivalent to the SIC and NAICS system:
* Standard Industrial Classification
* North American Industry Classification System.

This module is a rewrite of the older community module "partner_nace" from
the former `extra-addons` repository of Odoo v5 (called OpenERP at the time).
