The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.

The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.

Manufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in group 22.2.

Assembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components. 

The recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in group 38.3 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.

Specialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division 33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division 95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles). 

The installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in 33.20. 

Remark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NACE:
- fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see 10.20)
- milk pasteurising and bottling (see 10.51)
- leather converting (see 15.11)
- wood preserving (see 16.10)
- printing and related activities (see 18.1)
- tyre retreading (see 22.11)
- ready-mixed concrete production (see 23.63)
- electroplating, plating, and metal heat treating (see 25.61)
- rebuilding or remanufacture of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see 29.10)

Conversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of NACE; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include:
- logging, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);
- beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing); 
- preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities);
- beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section B (Mining and quarrying); 
- construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section F (Construction);
- activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order; treatment not resulting into a different good is classified to section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).","","""2","10","Manifattura ta' prodotti ta' l-ikel","","","","","10","This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products. The activity often generates associated products of greater or lesser value (for example, hides from slaughtering, or oilcake from oil production).

This division is organised by activities dealing with different kinds of products: meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, fats and oils, milk products, grain mill products, animal feeds and other food products. Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering.

Some activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers' own shop. However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to wholesale and retail trade (section G).

Preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division 56 (Food and beverage service activities).

Production of animal feeds from slaughter waste or by-products is classified in 10.9, while processing food and beverage waste into secondary raw material is classified to 38.3, and disposal of food and beverage waste in 38.21.","","This division does not include the preparation of meals for immediate consumption, such as in restaurants.""3","10.1","Ipproċessar u priservar ta' laħam u produzzjoni ta' prodotti tal-laħam","","","","","101","","","""4","10.11","Ipproċessar u priservar ta' laħam","","","","","1010","This class includes:

Problem statement: Where do we classify the (usually outsourced) cutting up of textile fabrics?

Units receive from the principal on a subcontracting basis textile fabrics fur cutting up, by using automats, such as laser equipment. The aim is to optimise the various parts to be cut and to minimise the scraps. All they do is to cut up the fabrics supplied by the principal and to return the cut up parts to the principal. 

Historically this activity is carried out by the manufacturer of the apparel and this outsourced part of the manufacturing process is a part of the manufacture of wearing apparel in division 14. Within division 14 and group 14.1 it could be any of the classes 14.12 to 14.19, depending on the type of wearing apparel ultimately to be produced from those cut up fabrics, but the subcontractor normally does not have information on the final use of the textile parts.

Solution: As the majority of the clothing covered in classes 14.12 to 14.19 would be in class 14.13 (manufacture of other outerwear) the outsourced cutting up of textile fabrics should subsequently also be classified to class 14.13.

The inclusions to class 14.13 also mention ""manufacture of parts of the products listed"".

The manufacture of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes. More than one activity is often carried out in a single unit. 

There are essentially three activities: The manufacture of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibres from other matter in wood, or dissolving and de-inking of used paper, and mixing in small amounts of reagents to reinforce the binding of the fibres. The manufacture of paper involves releasing pulp onto a moving wire mesh so as to form a continuous sheet. Converted paper products are made from paper and other materials by various techniques. 

The paper articles may be printed (e.g. wallpaper, gift wrap etc.), as long as the printing of information is not the main purpose.

Problem statement: Where is this drying and grinding of wet natural clay in order to get clay powder, fit for the production of ceramics classified?

Input material for the process is clay as extracted. It is too wet and too coarse-grained and does insofar not meet the needs for the production of ceramics. In a first step the raw clay will be dried in a dryer from 18% moisture content to about 8% moisture content. The temperature starts with 800°C and ends with 200°C. The high temperature produces steam which causes also a first kind of grinding (the steam breaks the material).

In a second step (a combined grinding and drying process) the material will be further dried to 1% moisture content and crushed to a particle size which is necessary for a use in the ceramic industry.

The output material is clay powder which is directly usable for the production of ceramics.

Solution: Considering the aspect of manufacturing of more elaborated products (as opposed to the basic operations that are classified to NACE Rev. 2 division 08 (Other mining and quarrying)) the drying and grinding of clay is classified to NACE Rev. 2 class 23.99 (Manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products n.e.c.).

The processes used in the manufacture of furniture are standard methods of forming materials and assembling components, including cutting, moulding and laminating. The design of the article, for both aesthetic and functional qualities, is an important aspect of the production process.

Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing. For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in division 16 (Manufacture of wood and wood products). However, the multiple processes distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing. Similarly, metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacture of roll-formed products classified in division 25 (Manufacture of fabricated metal products).

Problem statement: Where is the following activity carried out by a unit classified?
- A unit describing itself as a joint venture
- The unit does not have any assets or employees
- The unit is simply a mechanism for two architectural businesses to record and share fees from a specific client and declare them for taxation purposes

Solution: The Working Group specially noted that the joint venture does not have any assets or employees but is simply a mechanism established for taxation purposes, and for that reason it cannot fall under the scope of NACE Rev. 2 classes 64.20 (activities of holding companies) or 64.30 (trusts, funds and similar financial entities). The activity of the Special Purpose Entity should therefore be classified with the same activity as the partner companies.

Wholesaling and retailing are the final steps in the distribution of merchandise. Also included in this section are the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles.

Sale without transformation is considered to include the usual operations (or manipulations) associated with trade, for example sorting, grading and assembling of goods, mixing (blending) of goods (for example sand), bottling (with or without preceding bottle cleaning), packing, breaking bulk and repacking for distribution in smaller lots, storage (whether or not frozen or chilled).

Division 45 includes all activities related to the sale and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, while divisions 46 and 47 include all other sale activities. The distinction between division 46 (wholesale) and division 47 (retail sale) is based on the predominant type of customer.

Wholesale is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods to retailers, business-to-business trade, such as to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or resale to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for, or selling merchandise to, such persons or companies. The principal types of businesses included are merchant wholesalers, i.e. wholesalers who take title to the goods they sell, such as wholesale merchants or jobbers, industrial distributors, exporters, importers, and cooperative buying associations, sales branches and sales offices (but not retail stores) that are maintained by manufacturing or mining units apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products and that do not merely take orders to be filled by direct shipments from the plants or mines. Also included are merchandise and commodity brokers, commission merchants and agents and assemblers, buyers and cooperative associations engaged in the marketing of farm products. 

Wholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort and grade goods in large lots, break bulk, repack and redistribute in smaller lots, for example pharmaceuticals; store, refrigerate, deliver and install goods, engage in sales promotion for their customers and label design.

Retailing is the resale (sale without transformation) of new and used goods mainly to the general public for personal or household consumption or utilisation, in shops, department stores, stalls, mail-order houses, door-to-door sales persons, hawkers, consumer cooperatives, auction houses etc. Most retailers take title to the goods they sell, but some act as agents for a principal and sell either on consignment or on a commission basis.","","""2","45","Negozju bl-ingrossa u bl-imnut u tiswija ta' vetturi bil-mutur u muturi","","","","","45","This division includes all activities (except manufacture and rental) related to motor vehicles and motorcycles, including lorries and trucks, such as the wholesale and retail sale of new and second-hand vehicles, the repair and maintenance of vehicles and the wholesale and retail sale of parts and accessories for motor vehicles and motorcycles.

Problem statement: Where in NACE Rev. 2 are ""Ingenieurbüros für bautechnische Gesamtplanung"" (engineering consultants for constructional overall planning)? In CPA 2002 there are sub-categories 74.20.40 (""integrated engineering services for turnkey projects"") and 74.20.60 (""project management services related to construction and civil engineering works"").

Solution: Conclusion of the NACE/CPA Task Force 13-15 November 2006. The activity is in NACE Rev. 2 class 71.12. For terminology, see CPA 2002.

Decision date: 15.11.2006

Project management

Problem statement: [From US] (39/40) The definitions exclude project management. What is the definition of project management? If a general contractor subcontracts out each of the steps in the project to different subs - their role, beyond oversight and responsibility for the entire project, is essentially project management. Can a better term be found to describe what I think is the intent of this exclusion - to be in the engineering area, it might need to have arrangement of financing, site selection, etc. beyond those things that are just related to the construction.

Solution: Conclusion of the NACE/CPA Task Force 13-15 November 2006. “Project management activities related to construction” is classified in ISIC Rev.4 class 7110 and accordingly in NACE Rev. 2 class 71.12.

- Services of certifying units which consist in caring out inspections, giving or withdrawing certificates in field of ecological agriculture production, collection of wild plants or parts of them.

Solution: Even though it is recognised that there exists a great variety of certification activities, NACE Rev. 2 class 71.20 (technical testing and analysis) covers all aspects of this wide range of certification related activities. Ultimately the certification process is the same, no matter what is being certified. For that reason the certification activities referred to are and should stay classified to NACE Rev. 2 class 71.20 (technical testing and analysis), where they have always been classified.
