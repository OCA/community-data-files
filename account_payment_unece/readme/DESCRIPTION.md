This module adds a field *UNECE Payment Mean* on *Payment Methods* to be
able to use a standard written by the [United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe](http://www.unece.org) (which has 56 members
states in Europe, America and Central Asia, cf
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe)).
This standard define a codification of the payment modes, cf the
[official code
list](http://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/d99b/tred/tred4461.htm).

This codification is used for example in the two main international
standards for electronic invoicing:

- [Cross Industry
  Invoice](http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm)
  (CII),
- [Universal Business Language](http://ubl.xml.org/) (UBL)
