=============================
Product Unit of Measure UNECE
=============================

This module adds a field *UNECE Code* on units of measure to allow the use of a standard written by the `United Nations Economic Commission for Europe <http://www.unece.org>`_ (which has 56 members states in Europe, America and Central Asia, cf `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Economic_Commission_for_Europe>`_). The codification of the units of measures are defined in `UNECE/CEFACT Trade Facilitation Recommendation number 20 <http://www.unece.org/tradewelcome/un-centre-for-trade-facilitation-and-e-business-uncefact/outputs/cefactrecommendationsrec-index/list-of-trade-facilitation-recommendations-n-16-to-20.html>`_ (`direct link <http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/cefact/recommendations/rec20/rec20_Rev12e_2016.xls>`_ to revision 12).

This codification is used for example in the two main international standards for electronic invoicing:

* `Cross Industry Invoice <http://tfig.unece.org/contents/cross-industry-invoice-cii.htm>`_ (CII),
* `Universal Business Language <http://ubl.xml.org/>`_ (UBL).

Configuration
=============

This module automatically adds the UNECE Code on the existing units of measure.
